# Example: Sundiata Keita — The Lion King

📜 **Sundiata Keita — Mandinka Oral Tradition, ~1235**

> *"Nàani kélen tɛ́ se kà dùnkafa bìn"*
> — Mandinka proverb

🌍 "One hand cannot tie a bundle."

**The Story:** In 13th century West Africa, a boy named Sundiata was born crippled. He couldn't walk until age seven. The Mandinka court mocked him — his mother was humiliated, his siblings laughed. The sorcerer-king Soumaoro Kanté conquered their homeland and killed eleven of Sundiata's brothers. Everyone assumed the crippled boy was no threat. That was their mistake. Sundiata eventually stood, and when he did, he literally pulled himself up using an iron rod that bent under his grip. He went into exile, built alliances across West Africa, and returned with an army. At the Battle of Kirina in 1235, he defeated Soumaoro and founded the Mali Empire — which would become one of the wealthiest civilizations in human history. His first act as emperor? He proclaimed the Manden Charter (Kouroukan Fouga), one of the world's earliest declarations of human rights — abolishing slavery among member clans, establishing freedom of speech, and mandating food security. Seven centuries before the UN Universal Declaration.

💡 **Modern Connection:** Every investor has a "pattern" for what founders look like. Sundiata broke every pattern — crippled, exiled, written off. His story is the original "they laughed at me at the pitch meeting" narrative, except the pitch meeting was a West African royal court and the product was an empire spanning 500,000 square miles. The Manden Charter is equally wild: a 13th century African emperor codifying human rights that Europe wouldn't articulate for another 500 years. Next time someone says "move fast and break things," remember Sundiata moved slowly for seven years, then broke an entire empire in one battle.
