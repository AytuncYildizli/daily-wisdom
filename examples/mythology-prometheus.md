# Example: Prometheus — Fire Thief

📜 **Prometheus — Greek Mythology / Hesiod's Theogony, ~700 BC**

> *"πρὸ γὰρ ἐμήσατο αἰπὺν ὄλεθρον, κλέψας ἀκαμάτοιο πυρὸς τηλέσκοπον αὐγήν"*
> — Hesiod, Theogony 565-566

🌍 "He devised sheer ruin for himself, having stolen the far-seen gleam of unwearying fire."

**The Story:** Zeus hid fire from humans as punishment. Prometheus — a Titan, not a god — stole it back inside a hollow fennel stalk and gave it to mortals. For this crime, Zeus chained him to a rock in the Caucasus mountains where an eagle ate his liver every day. Every night the liver regrew. Every morning the eagle returned. Forever. But here's what most retellings skip: Prometheus knew this would happen. His name literally means "forethought." He calculated the cost, decided humanity having fire was worth eternal torture, and did it anyway. He wasn't tricked or surprised. He chose suffering with full knowledge. The Greeks considered him the reason humans have civilization at all — not just warmth, but metalworking, cooking, pottery, and eventually every technology that followed. Zeus punished not just Prometheus but humanity too, sending Pandora with her box. The message: knowledge has a cost, and someone always pays.

💡 **Modern Connection:** Every whistleblower is a Prometheus story. Edward Snowden stole fire (NSA surveillance data) and gave it to mortals (the public). He knew the eagle was coming. Aaron Swartz tried to make academic papers free and the system chained him to a rock. But the deeper pattern is in open source itself — every developer who releases proprietary knowledge as free code is performing a tiny Prometheus act. The liver grows back (the company can rebuild), but the fire is out there now and can't be taken back. And Zeus's reaction? Always the same: make an example of the thief so nobody tries it again. It never works. Someone always steals fire.
