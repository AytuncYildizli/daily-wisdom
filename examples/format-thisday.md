📅 **On This Day: February 15**

**1564** — Galileo Galilei is born in Pisa. He'll grow up to point a telescope at Jupiter, discover four moons, and get house-arrested for suggesting the Earth isn't the center of everything.

The Church's objection wasn't really about astronomy — it was about authority. If one man with a lens could overturn a thousand years of doctrine, what else might people start questioning?

**The detail nobody mentions:** Galileo didn't invent the telescope. A Dutch spectacle maker named Hans Lippershey did. Galileo just pointed it *up*. The tool already existed. The insight was directional.

**Why it matters today:** Every breakthrough tool (LLMs, blockchain, CRISPR) already exists. The Galileo move isn't building the next tool — it's pointing the existing one somewhere nobody thought to look. OpenAI didn't invent transformers. They just pointed them at *everything*.

And the house arrest? Galileo spent it writing his best work. Constraints breed creativity — always have, always will.
