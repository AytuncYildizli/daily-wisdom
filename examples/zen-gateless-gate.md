# Example: Short Format — Zen Koan

> Alternative format: Minimal, punchy, no modern connection. Let it sit.

📜 **Mumonkan (The Gateless Gate) — Zen Master Mumon, 1228**

> *"無"*
> — Zhaozhou's answer to "Does a dog have Buddha-nature?"

A monk asked Master Zhaozhou: "Does a dog have Buddha-nature?"

Zhaozhou said: "Mu." (Nothing/No/Not.)

This single syllable has been the first koan assigned to Zen students for 800 years. There is no correct intellectual answer. "Yes" is wrong. "No" is wrong. "Mu" isn't really "no" — it's the sound of the question dissolving.

The point isn't to answer it. The point is to sit with it until the question itself stops making sense.

Try it with your hardest current problem. Not "what's the answer?" but: what if the question is wrong?
